## About this Project

The idea of the page is:

Challenge myself and see what I'm capable of and serve as a learning assessment for completing Module 01 of the VaiNaWeb Front-end course.

## Why?

This project is part of my personal portfolio, with the design developed by VaiNaWeb, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer !
